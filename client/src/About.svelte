      Hi, I am Adam Tropp, a software engineer specializing in web development
      with Javascript. I hail from New Jersey, and have also spent significant
      time living in the San Francisco Bay Area, which I consider my second
      (read: "real") home. At the time of this writing, I have 23 years of life
      under my belt. When I am not
      <a
        target="blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">
        performing ritualistic sacrifices to the machines that will one day be
        our overlords
      </a>
      , you might find me:
    </p>
    <li>Playing poker</li>
    <li>Playing guitar</li>
    <li>Playing Basketball</li>
    <li>
      Playing the ancient Chinese board game
      <a target="blank" href="https://online-go.com/player/590574">Go</a>
    </li>
    <li>Consuming the written word</li>
    <li>Watching baseball or football</li>
    <li>Listening to hip hop</li>
  </div>
  <p>Other things you might (but probably don't) want to know about me:</p>
  <li>
    I have been a staunch nihilist since about age 12, when I came to the
    inexorable conclusion that religion is a load of horse shit, and that, as
    Yuval Noah Harari said, there can, ipso facto, be no meaning to life without
    an intelligent designer that deemed it so.
  </li>
  <li>I can say the ABCs backwards</li>
  <li>
    I have, on two separate occasions in my life, walked through a drive-through
    Burger King. The second time, the dude thought I was homeless and didn't
    want to let me order, so some girls in a car ordered for me.
  </li>
  <li>Charlie from Always Sunny is my spirit animal</li>
  <p>
    Eventually, I plan to make this site into a repository for all the things I
    love, including my thoughts and ramblings about stuff that isn't code. So if
    you are interested in hearing such things, you have come to the right place!
    And if not... well.... you're here, so I guess maybe you gotta reevaluate
    that position.
